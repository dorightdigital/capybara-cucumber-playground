Capybara Cucumber Playground
===

I find myslef recommending Capybara to many companies and developers, not all of them are familiar with ruby.  To make this process simpler this is a demo project which people can use as a playground or take as a base implementation to import into their own project.  The features are:

 - Cucumber
 - Capybara
 - Using browser:
   - Phantom (using Poltergiest)

I'd like to add:

 - Browsers:
   - Firefox
   - Chrome
   - Selenium
   - Selenium Grid

How to use
===

1. Make sure ruby is installed `ruby -v` - I'd recommend 2.0.0 or later, if it's not or you want to upgrade visit https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
2. Make sure bundler is installed `bundle -v`, if it's not installed run `gem install bundler`
3. Install dependencies `bundle install`
4. Run the tests `bundle exec cucumber`
