Capybara Cucumber Playground
===

I find myslef recommending Capybara to many companies and developers, not all of them are familiar with ruby.  To make this process simpler this is a demo project which people can use as a playground or take as a base implementation to import into their own project.  The features are:

 - Cucumber
 - Capybara
 - Using browser:
   - Phamtom (using Poltergiest)

I'd like to add:

 - Browsers:
   - Firefox
   - Chrome
   - Selenium
   - Selenium Grid
